## Beginning
Today is Feb 7th 2019. My mother passed away about 6 years ago and my father passed away about 3 years ago, which put out most of fire in my heart . I start to lost my enthusiasm on both work and life since then even though I have a lovely 5 years old son. I had a pretty good and stable job before. I know all the details and people look up me due to my professioal. But one day, the 3rd party complains seriously due to my altitude (too much bossy I guess) for them. I start to think about if I had changed to the one I do not like. I know it is time to look new things to restart the fire in my heart. I changed jobs two times and still do not feel right. Until I start to lean data analysis, start to learn the Python, the cs109 of Harvard, I have a kind of feeling that this is what I like. I use github to write down my feeling, my progress, which I think it is a good way to learn it. I hope I can find new me in this Way
